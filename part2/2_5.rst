Raster processing
=================

The aim of this exercise is to provide you some skills about raster data analysis and processing, starting by some very basic tools on QGIS that can help in it. During this exercise we will use the following layers that you have already been working with:

- **Raster Data:**

   - *Land_cover*
   - *Temperature_distribution*

- **Vector Data**, to be used for the *overlay analysis*:

   - *Municipalities_OSM*

Add them to QGIS from the Geopackage you were provided to your **Layers panel**. It is advisable to load also the raster data styles that you were given in the exercise folder (see exercise on :ref:`raster visualization on QGIS <1.9>`) in a way to better visualize the data while analysing and processing them.

This exercise will start from some basic activities and checks that are usually taken before processing (as reprojection and removing noData) to follow then with operations and tools that can be very useful when working with raster data as Raster calculator, Vectorization, Clip and Overlay statistics. All these operations and tools can be used separately, in different order or in different ways to obtain some geospatial information from your raster data.

Reprojection
------------

When you load raster data on QGIS, before starting any processing, you should look at their properties, that need to be adequate for the steps you are going to take and for the output you want to create. Here, reprojection tool can be fundamental. Indeed, raster data, as well as a whole QGIS Project, can refer to a certain **map projection** and, more specifically to a Coordinate Reference System (:ref:`CRS <1.2>`) that links map locations to real places on Earth. It can happen that your raster data are referred to different CRS, and, in that case, you would not be able to compare or combine them without reprojecting them to a common CRS. Also, it can happen that the processing output needs to be referred to a CRS and so reprojection tool must be used.

A good rule is to check at the beginning the raster data CRS. It can be checked under **CRS** voice by going to each layer **Properties → information**. In this exercise, you can check that all data are referred to “*CRS: EPSG:32632 - WGS 84 / UTM zone 32N – Projected*”. Therefore, we would not need to do any reprojection.

However, to learn how to reproject data, let us apply reprojection to *Land_cover*. Look at :numref:`2.5.1.1` to follow with numbers in brackets the different steps that here will be mentioned.

To start, go to **Raster Menu** on QGIS **→ Projections (1) → Warp (Reproject) (2)**: it will open the *Warp (Reproject)* window. There, you need to set the **input layer** (*Land_Cover*) **(3)**, with its **input CRS** (*Project CRS: EPSG:32632 - WGS 84 / UTM zone 32N*) **(4)** and the final desired CRS, the **target CRS** (here choose *EPSG: 2056-CH1903+/LV95*) **(5)**. Leave the rest as it is and click on **Run** to reproject the raster in a new CRS. To choose the target CRS, by clicking on the icon **(5)**, after having unchecked **No CRS box (6)** in the new window, you can search for the wanted target CRS **(7)**: as in :numref:`2.5.1.1` **(7)** search for *EPSG: 2056* and then select the option for the *swiss Obl. Mercator projected CS* **(8)**.

   -- Raster data Reprojection steps.

The new added raster, called *reprojected* is a temporary File. This reprojected File still perfectly overlaps with the original one, even though the two layers have different CRS. This is because QGIS_3 automatically applies “on the fly” CRS transformation for both raster and vector data. This means that, for visualization, layers with different CRS are transformed into the project’s CRS (here the *EPSG:32632 - WGS 84 / UTM zone 32N*)  provided that the input layers CRS is stored in their metadata and that it is correct. Thus, to see the CRS change you can go to *reprojected* layer **Properties → Source** and change its *source CRS*: in this way, you won’t see anymore the reprojected File together with the original one, and, to visualize it, you will have to Zoom to its extent. That is because now QGIS has no more reprojected it ‘on the fly’ and you can see therefore the effects of referring to a different CRS.

Removing NoData
---------------

Go back to the original *Land_Cover* layer on which you have applied the *Land_Cover_style*, provided to you in the exercise folder. As already noticed during the :ref:`Raster visualization on QGIS <1.9>` exercise, this style contains more classes and values than the ones really present in this area, because it was created for the whole *Corine Land Cover map* that is much wider than this portion we are referring to. Particularly, the *Land_Cover_style* 999-NODATA class, corresponding to value 48, is not present in our area under study, you can check it by visualizing the raster with *Singleband-grey* render type, to see it contains no pixels with value 48. Therefore, you can remove this class visualization from *Land_Cover_style*, by clicking on **minus** icon (:numref:`2.5.2.1`, **(2)**) and you can re-save the style.

There is another huge difference when visualizing this raster with *Singleband-grey* render type: the *Land_Cover* layer contains pixels with 0 value that are no more visible when loading again the *Land_Cover_style*. See :numref:`2.5.2.1` to follow the steps to visualize them also with the *Land_Cover_style*: use the **+** button **(3)** in the **Properties → Simbology** window, to add a new class to be visualized: by assigning to it value 0, *NoData* label and an evident color as black **(4)**, you will see again, on borders, black pixels with 0 value that will appear also with this *Land_Cover_style*.

.. _2.5.2.1:
.. figure:: /img/2/2.5.2.1.png
   
   -- Visualize NoData pixels on the Land_Cover_style.

These black pixels are due to a previous conversion from Coordinate Reference System to a projection, during which they have remained empty. It is preferable to change their 0 value with **null** value, in a way to exclude them from following calculations. See on :numref:`2.5.2.2` the operations to be made. Go to **Processing Toolbox (1) → GRASS → Raster → r.null (2)** and open **r.null** window where it is requested the raster map for which to edit null values **(3)** (*Land_Cover [EPSG:32632]*), the list of cell values to be set to null **(4)** (here type 0) and finally where to save the new raster file. By clicking on **Run**, a new raster will be created without the 0 value pixels.

Raster calculator
-----------------

The Raster Calculator tool allows to perform calculations based on the raster pixel values. Calculations are computed on each pixel value and the result is a new raster whose pixel values are the corresponding results from calculations on the corresponding pixels. It is a great tool that can be useful for several applications and for very different operations to apply.

Let us apply it on *Temperature_distribution* raster data.  Before, **remove NoData** from this layer by applying **r.null** on it, setting to null its *nan* values (stored in the pixels among the lakes). 

Suppose that we want to find out the areas in the lakes with the lowest water surface temperatures. First, look at the distribution of values in the raster: the highest detected temperatures are obviously distributed along the borders of the lakes and are fewer with respect to the lower temperatures in the centre of the lakes. It is possible to look also at the raster data histogram (**Properties → histogram**) to see that the most of values are around 12,5°, thus, to find out where the lowest temperatures are localised, let us consider 12° as temperature of reference.

Now, apply **Raster Calculator**. See :numref:`2.5.3.1` for the steps. Under **Raster** Menu go to **Raster Calculator…**: it will open a window where to insert the following operation **(1)** to be performed:

::

   (“Temperature_distribution@1"< 12 )  * 1 + ("Temperature_distribution@1" >= 12 ) * 2 

Particularly, with Raster Calculator, it is recommendable to insert the different signs and layers through *Operators* and *Raster Bands* buttons.

Our operation is mostly of a logical type (using < and >=): in QGIS, the results of a logical formula can be 1=True or 0=False: therefore, when we input, for example, (Temperature_distribution@1"< 12)* 1  the result here will be 1 or 0 for each pixel, summed to the result of ("Temperature_distribution@1" >= 12 ) * 2 that will be 0 or 2. Obviously one number cannot be contemporarily < or >= 12 therefore the whole result will be 1 or 2. Before running the computation insert in **(2)** where to save the new raster layer: when choosing for the name of the new raster you can use *lowest_temperatures*.

After running, a new raster layer will be added to your QGIS project. After changing its render type to *Paletted/unique values*, you should get a result similar to the one in :numref:`2.5.3.1` with pixels with only 1 and 2 values.

   -- Raster Calculator steps and result.

Vectorization
-------------

The following exercise will be performed on the *lowest_temperatures* layer, the raster resulting from the previous Raster Calculator exercise. Vectorization is the operation to convert a raster layer into a vector one, particularly here into a polygon one.

See :numref:`2.5.4.1` to follow with the instructions. Go to **Raster** Menu **→ Conversion → Polygonize (Raster to Vector)**.  In *Polygonize (Raster to Vector)* Window enter the **Input layer (1)** (*lowest_temperatures*),the **name of the attribute field to create** related to the raster values **(2)** (*Low-notLow*) and finally where to save the vectorized File (here named as *TemperaturesLow_notLow*) **(3)**. Finally, the result will be a polygon layer. As you have already learnt in the exercise of :ref:`Vector Visualization <1.8>`, change the polygon style into a *categorized* symbolisation, hide polygon with NoData value (it could be a huge negative value, depending by your machine precision, e.g. -2147483648) and the polygon symbol for ‘other values’: you will get the layer visualization that you can see at the end in :numref:`2.5.4.1`.

Clip raster with a mask, clip raster by extent
----------------------------------------------

Sometimes raster data cover a wider area than the one under study, thus, data can be much heavy and processing slowed down. In this case, it is always advisable to reduce the raster extent by clipping out the area that is not under study. There are more ways to do it, in this exercise we will focus on **clipping with a mask** (using another layer as reference) and on **clipping by extent** (taking as reference a manually drawn area).

Consider the *temperatures_distribution* layer. Suppose you want to study only the Maggiore lake area: it is possible to clip the *temperature_distribution* layer by a manually rectangular drawn region that would exclude the other two lakes. Refer to :numref:`2.5.5.1` to follow on with the instructions. Go to **Raster** Menu **→ Extraction → Clip Raster by Extent…**. It will open a window where to input the layer to be clipped **(1)** (*Temperature_distribution*) and the *clipping extent*: click on **…**  button **(2)** and then on **Select Extent on Canvas (3)** to manually draw on your project the clipping area, a red rectangle on Maggiore lake **(4)**. Then, for this exercise, just save it as *temporary File*, **Run** and the result will be the layer of temperatures cropped just on the Maggiore lake.

.. _2.5.5.1:

   -- Clip Raster by extent, steps and result.

Now, on the other hand, let us see how to clip a raster with a mask. When clipping with a vector mask it is possible also to decide which categories of the polygon vector to be used to mask the raster data. Suppose here we want to mask the *temperature_distribution* layer for where its temperatures are the lowest, thus where the *TemperaturesLow_notLow* polygons have value 1. Click on **Select Features by value** and set *low_notLow* field *equal* to value *1*, to select the polygons with the lowest temperatures. Then, go to **Raster** Menu **→ Extraction → Clip Raster by Mask Layer…**, **input layer:** *Temperature_distribution*, to be masked by *TemperaturesLow_notLow* vector layer, check the **Selected Features only** box (to mask the raster with just the selected polygons of the mask layer) assign 0 as **NoData Value** and **Save to a temporary File**. In the end, the new added layer should cover with temperature values, only the areas of low water surface temperature.


Overlay statistics
------------------

Raster data allow to easily compare and combine different data referred to the same territory. In this way, they allow also to easily compute overlay statistics that can be a powerful tool to investigate some areas. **Zonal statistics** algorithm is an example of the overlay statistics that can be computed from the combination of a raster and a vector layer. This tool, from raster data, calculates statistics (e.g. mean, max, min…) for each feature of the overlapping vector layer.

To better understand it, suppose that we want to know the municipalities with the coldest or hottest surface water temperatures. By overlapping the vector layer *Municipalities_OSM* to the *Temperature_distribution* raster, lakes areas are subdivided in smaller portions according to the municipalities they are part of. Therefore, it could be possible to derive some statistics for each of these portions of lakes.

See :numref:`2.5.6.1`. Go to the **Processing Toolbox → Raster Analysis → Zonal statistics** insert as **input raster**  the *Temperature_distribution* layer **(1)** and as **vector layer containing zones** the *Municipalities_OSM* vector **(2)**. Then name the **Output column prefix** *LakeTemp* **(3)** and select the **statistics to be calculated** (here **mean**, **max** and **min**), by clicking on the “**…**” button **(4)**. The algorithm will add to *Municipalities_OSM* attribute table three new columns, one for each calculated statistic. To check the results, click on *LakeTempmean* column to sort features from the highest to the lowest value: you should find that it is *Melide* municipality the one with the highest mean lake surface temperature (22°) while *Valmadrera* is the one with the lowest lake surface temperature (11,7°) on the same day.

   -- Zonal Statistics algorithm, steps and result.

Try to do it also on the single Maggiore lake temperature distribution layer that you have cut in the previous exercise (clip by extent) to get the municipalities with the highest or lowest mean temperature for just that lake area.
