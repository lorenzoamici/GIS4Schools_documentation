QGIS interface
==============

Typical appearance of QGIS main graphical user interface (:numref:`1.6.1`) consists of:

1. **Bar Menu**: main features and functions
2. **Toolbar**: common features in a single click
3. **Layer panel**: list of the project layers
4. **Map panel**: geographic display of active layers
5. **Status bar**: current coordinates, scale, rotation, and coordinate system

Additional panels and toolbars can be activated or deactivated from **View (1) → Panels (2)** or **View (2) → Toolbars(3)**. Alternatively, we can right-click on an empty space (without icons) **(4)** in the Toolbars or Menu bar section and we will get a full list of available panels and toolbars (:numref:`1.6.2`).

Moreover, we can choose/modify QGIS project properties. It can be done from menu **Project (1) → Properties (2)**. Here we can modify different points of project properties such as general project properties, metadata, CRS, default style, etc. (:numref:`1.6.3`)

Finally, the appearance of QGIS can be affected by the settings of the software itself. From menu **Settings (1)** select **Options (2)** to conﬁgure the ways to use QGIS (:numref:`1.6.4`). For example, we can change the general settings, or settings related to the system, CRS, data sources, etc.
